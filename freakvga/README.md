Old non-uft8 x11 font created using one of my vga textmode fonts.

Original readme:

```plaintext
nice (?) new X11 fixed font by freakpie@lix.intercom.es

*** UPDATE *** new fkp.pcf from xfreakt.fnt ***
***            this mew font handles pretty ***
***            well those ISO line chars as ***
***            in midnight commander or cdp ***

fkp.pcf has also changed the font name to fkp so u can use fkp.pcf and
vga.pcf at the same time...

freakt.fnt is a 8 bit (not 9) text font
(i've got also a nicer 9.bit font, for linux console only though)

i *know* its a very lame tweak... =)
