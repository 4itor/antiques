# AdLib multichannel piano

* Year: 1996
* OS: MS-DOS
* Source: Turbo assembler

Small piano using the PC keyboard, multichannel and multikey. Keyboard `MAKE` and `BREAK` scancodes are converted into note begin/ends; Each note also had a small decay.

It was created as an experiment to use adlib music in demos/intros. Created also a couple of tools with the intention of converting them into a full adlib tracker, that never saw the light.

Full source included.
